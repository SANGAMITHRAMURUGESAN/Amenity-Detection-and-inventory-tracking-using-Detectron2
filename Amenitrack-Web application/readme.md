This directory encompasses the source code for our software application, "Amenitrack." Within the application, there exist distinct user profiles, namely guests and hosts, each equipped with various functionalities such as amenity detection and inventory tracking for hosts. Furthermore, to enhance transparency and provide stakeholders with insightful tools, we've incorporated visualizations such as maps and line charts. These visual representations are generated using the Folium API, offering an intuitive means for stakeholders to comprehend and manage the data effectively.
